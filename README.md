## Introduction
In short, SGP is, to the best of our knowledge, the first general framework for feature learning in geometric perception without any supervision from ground-truth geometric labels. 

SGP runs in an EM fashion. It iteratively performs robust estimation of the geometric models to generate pseudo-labels, and feature learning under the supervision of the noisy pseudo-labels.

We applied SGP to camera pose estimation and point cloud registration, demonstrating performance that is on par or even superior to supervised oracles in large-scale real datasets.

### Camera pose estimation

Deep image features like [CAPS](https://github.com/qianqianwang68/caps) can be trained with relative pose labels generated by 5pt-RANSAC, bootstraped with the handcrafted SIFT feature. They can be later used in robust relative camera pose estimation.

### Point cloud registration

Deep 3D features like [FCGF](https://github.com/chrischoy/FCGF) can be trained with relative pose labels generated by 3pt-RANSAC, bootstraped by the handcrafted FPFH feature. They can be later used in robust point cloud registration.
